/*
- create a program using arrays that sort a list of integers in ascending order
- set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard
- implement the following methods - getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
- getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
- printArray prints out the contents of the array
and sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
-you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into a new
array and sort them and return the new sorted array
